<hr><h2>Pump Update - 2 June 2014</h2>
<p>Included in this release:</p>
<ul class="spacedlist">
	<li>Bug fixes from recent site issues - see details below.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installer</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
  <li>Update for TLS-350R setups: Installer checks existing VedderRoot.dll and automatically detects if existing system is using zero based hose numbers for the delivery end message.  If it detects that zero based hose numbers are being used then it will add the ZeroBaseHoseNumber=1 setting to C:\Enabler\ITLIntegrate.ini so that this behaviour will not change with the addition of the updated VedderRoot.dll. For more details see Veeder Root changes below. (#13472) </li>
</ul>

<h3>Veeder Root Tank Gauge (VeederRoot.DLL) v2.1.9</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
  <li>Update for TLS-350R setups: Added loading of setting to export the hose number in the delivery end message as 0 based (so hose number 1 export as 0, hose number 2 export as 1 etc).  This is to allow sites to configure the system to match the driver behaviour before v2.0.1 where the driver was updated to always export hose numbers as 1 based (hose number 1 exported as 1, hose number 2 export as 2). To trigger this add the INI file setting ZeroBaseHoseNumber=1 to the file C:\Enabler\ITLIntegrate.ini (create the file if not doesn't exist) under the section [TankGauge]. Pump Server will require a restart to pick up the setting.  Removing the setting from the file or setting to 0 will result in default behaviour of having 1 based hose numbers . (#13472) </li>

</ul>

<h3>Larsen & Toubro (LarsenAndToubro.DLL) v1.2.6</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Fix: Delivery is now logged correctly when it exceeds 16777 dollars (Spot #7147).</li>
</ul>

   <li>Fix: Updated configuration of meters to support Tokheim Quantium pumps. (Spot #6829)</li>      
   <li>Fix: Added version checks so that tank gauges will work irregardless of Pump Server version. (Spot #6182)</li>
   <li>Fix: When the pump reaches a limit or otherwise stops by itself, the pump icon now shows "delivery finishing" rather than "stopped". This prevents the pump from being re-authorised. In particular some Gilbarco SK700s would react badly when re-authorised at a limit, producing an extra delivery. (Spot #6713, #4840)</li>
   <li>The "stopped" state is only shown if stop was explicitly requested by Enabler.</li>   
</ul>

<!-- -->
<br><h2>Pump Update - 11 August 2009</h2>

<h3>Maser (Maser.DLL) v1.2.3</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Fix: delivery not logged in some situations. The driver has been updated to ensure reliable delivery logging (Spot #6716). This issue was encountered in the following situations - in both cases the pump showed as calling before logging the previous delivery:</li>
 <ol>
  <li>Pump offline during delivery.</li>
  <li>Nozzle replaced and lifted quickly during delivery.</li>
 </ol>
</ul>

<h3>Wayne Dart (Dart.DLL) v2.22.0</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Updated event message text for Reset command to avoid confusion. (Spot#6613)</li>

<!-- -->
<br><h2>Pump Update - 11 June 2009</h2>

<h3>Enabler Card firmware (Enb286b1.nxe) v2.86 build 01</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Added Larsen & Toubro MPD protocol support.</li>
 <li>This firmware resolves a BootID issue with v2.81b1 (Spot #5844).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dong Hwa (DongHwa.DLL) v1.2.13</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Fix: previously presets were not removed from the pump when cancelled in Enabler. If a limit is cancelled in Enabler, the pump preset will now be cleared.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Email (Email.DLL) v2.8.8</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Fix: added code to de-authorise if the pump reports an authorised state without specific authorisation from The Enabler (Spot #6420).</li>
 <li>Enhanced for more reliable communication with old Email pump models: Eclipse, Epitronic, ECC/Pacesetter, and Image. Pump state changes are confirmed to avoid random changes caused by electronic interference, which can occur due to the lack of checksum in the protocol. This does <b>not</b> apply to newer models such as Vision and MPP.</li>
 <li>Fix: MPP limits can be sent to wrong pump (Spot# 5242).</li>
 <li>Fix: if the nozzle is replaced and then lifted again within a few seconds, the delivery is now correctly logged. Previously it would show "delivery starting" and the delivery was not logged until the hose was replaced again (Spot# 5558).</li>
 <li>Improved handling of errors in the pump:</li>
 <ul>
   <li>Error events now include the Email error number as additional information.</li>
   <li>Eclipse: don't journal an event if it reports error 2, since this happens normally when the price changes (Spot #5510).</li>
   <li>Eclipse: if an error is being displayed the money amount is overwritten. The delivery is now logged with a zero money value, instead of 0.0x where x is the error number. The actual money value cannot be retrieved in this case due to the pump design (Spot #5603, #5605).</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Fix: prevent multiple authorisation commands being sent to Vision pumps to clear startup state. Theoretically, this could result in the pump being pre-authorised with the nozzle in, although testing shows that does not seem to occur (Spot #5629).</li>
 <li>Fix: don't waste time retrieving electronic totals several times at startup.</li>
 <li>Fix: If pump server/PC is restarted during a delivery, the delivery is no longer stopped. (Spot #5584).</li>
 <li>Fix: Vision: correctly report IDLE_PSTATE when the nozzle is in but authorised (Spot# 5636)</li>
 <li>Fix: occasional wrong pump numbers in logging.</li>
 <li>Internal refactoring for maintainability.</li>
</ul>

<h3>EPS (EPS.DLL) v2.3.7</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Fix: Implemented delivery abort functionality (Spot #6382).</li>
 <li>Restored a timer after pump reports delivery complete to ensure reliable delivery logging. This timeout is required because sometimes the pump doesn't sent nozzle status as expected.</li>
 <li>Fixed processing of lost delivery messages from the pump (Spot #6382).</li>
</ul>

<h3>IFSF (IFSF.DLL) v3.3.13</h3>
<p>We have reworked our IFSF driver to configure pumps in a more flexible way, so that it is compatible with a wider range of pumps, particularly newer Gilbarco and Tokheim models. </p>
<ul class="spacedlist">
   <li>Fix: updated for compatibility with pumps that have not-installed Fuelling Positions (Spot #5893).</li>
   <li>Fix: did not correctly change prices on pumps with non-sequential product numbers. The driver now correctly handles this situation. (Spot #5989)</li>
   <li>Fix: problem that caused pumps to be marked as NOT_RESPONDING when multiple authorisations were done close together. Now prevents a second authorisation before the last authorisation attempt has completed. (Spot #6013)</li>
   <li>Fix: Historical transaction configuration now ignored on startup to cover more IFSF variants. (Spot #5621, #5262)</li>
   <li>Fix: Improved logic of writing product numbers.</li>
   <li>Added configuration information on log file rollover. (Spot #4940)</li>
   <li>Improved handling of pump configuration errors.</li>
   <li>Fix: pump server memory corruption with node address > 4. This may affect any site using more than 4 physical dispensers and can result in other Enabler ports not working, pump server unable to shutdown and other symptoms. (Spot #4857)</li>
   <li>Fix: crash if a dispenser error event arrives early during processing. This prevents all pumps operating until a restart. (Spot #4510)</li>
   <li>Fix: respond to pump requests to Enabler itself as for SK700II and other Gilbarco-Salzkotten pumps. This problem could prevent pumps from starting up smoothly as the pumps would not respond to Enabler requests. (Spot #4646)</li>
   <li>Fix: tank levels are now kept even if the gauge goes offline.  Previously, they were all zeroed out.</li>   
   <li>Enhanced management and detection of pump configuration (nozzle/product mapping, meter readings, fuelling points, display formats).</li>
   <li>Water volume is now computed based on Gross Volume and Observed Volume.</li>
   <li>Added Observed_Density(45h) in probe levels read and saved.</li>
   <li>Improved timer handling.</li>
   <li>Enhanced to make use of new Pump Server logic for electronic totals processing.</li>      
   <li>Improved logging and message validation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ITLMPPSIM (ITLMPPSIM.DLL) v1.2.5</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Price change timer reduced to 7 seconds (previously was 70 seconds).</li>
 <li>Fix: preset limit error.</li>
 <li>Fix: maximum money was fixed at $990.0, now maximum limits vary depending on display format configuration.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Larsen & Toubro (LarsenAndToubro.DLL) v1.2.5</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Fix: added code to not allow authorisation when attempting to authorise pump for a preset and the preset has not been successful yet.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Larsen & Toubro MPD (LarsenAndToubroMPD.DLL) v1.1.1</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">

 <li>Renamed Maser pump type names for clarity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nuovo Pignone (NuovoPignone.DLL) v1.8.9</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Fix: added code to de-authorise if the pump reports an authorised state without specific authorisation from The Enabler (Spot #6420).</li>
</ul>

<h3>SAM (SAM.DLL) v2.5.9</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Changed the way we figure out the product to request totals for after a delivery (related to Spot#1302).</li>
 <li>Reduced un-necessary diagnostic logging.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tatsuno Partyline (Partyline.DLL) v2.11.6</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Improved reliability of delivery retrieval and logging.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tatsuno SS-LAN (Tatsuno.DLL) v2.7.15</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">

</ul>

<h3>Wayne (Wayne.DLL) v2.7.5</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Fix: decimal digits in Electronic Totals are now configurable using Advanced Settings (Spot #6518) - refer to the <a href="http://www.integration.co.nz/privdocs/FAQ-WayneCL.htm">Wayne US</a> article for more information:</li>
 <ul>
   <li>Volume Total DP is now configurable using VOLUME_TOT_DP=x</li>

<h3>Larsen & Toubro (LarsenAndToubro.DLL) v1.2.3</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Fix: Electronic volume totals are now retrieved correctly - in previous versions these were reported as 10x larger than the correct value.</li>
 <li>Fix: Changed processing for volume decimal positions to allow changes in Enabler display format.</li>
 <li>Enhanced to operate correctly with newer Z-Line pumps (firmware 18005 and later). Previously these pumps would fail to initialise correctly and showed "not responding" repeatedly.</li>
 <li>Now uses The Enabler Display Configuration to interpret delivery money and volume for increased compatibility (Spot#5918). Previously data from the pump would be used, resulting in incorrectly large money and volume figures.</li>

<h3>Wayne Dart (Dart.DLL) v2.20.3</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
  <li>Added <b>Wayne DART Full</b> pump type which enables the "full" features: Pause+Resume and Electronic Totals. You can use this as a simpler way to get a full-featured DART setup, rather than individually entering advanced settings USEPAUSE=1 and ETOTALS=1. Wayne or Wayne Pignone pumps manufactured since about 2000 should work with these features. Earlier pumps such as those based on the Duplex II computer will <b>not</b> support them. </li>
  <li>Added support for <b>Pause+Resume</b> feature. You <b>must test</b> that the pause/resume works with each pump before relying on it. This feature is activated either by the Wayne DART Full pump type, or with the USEPAUSE=1 advanced setting. </li>
  <li>Added logging of <b>pump errors</b>. When the pump reports an error it will be logged to the Enabler Event Log (Enabler Manager's Application - View Events tab).</li>
  <li>Accurate <b>pump limits</b> are now used by default, instead of remote limits. You can still force the driver to use remote limits instead by the USEREMOTELIMIT=1 setting. </li>
  <li>Fix: on Duplex II computers, when using pump limits, the limit would be remembered for the nex delivery. The limit is now cleared before each delivery. (Spot #5951) </li>
  <li>Fix: delivery not logged if comms lost for > 10 seconds on Wayne-Pignone CNG/NGV pumps (OTP-ELT pump computer). (Spot #5728, #5739) </li>
  <li>Electronic totals support for CNG/NGV pump variants (use Wayne DART Full pump type, or ETOTALS=1 advanced setting). </li>
  <li>If enabled, electronic totals are now requested at startup/connect as well as after delivery. </li>
  <li>Fix: correct operation when the Windows System Tick counter wraps around (Spot #4649). </li>

  <li>Gilbarco US specific: </li>
  <ul>
  	<li>Fix: Gilbarco US Extended pump type now works on Chinese manufactured Gilbarco US pumps.  Previously using the Gilbarco US Extended pump type with these pumps would result in the pump staying in Undefined Error Pstate. (Spot #5024) </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Gilbarco Australia specific:</li>
  <ul>
	<li>The running total decimal places calculation is now fixed to two decimal places.  Previously it was based on the Volume Decimal setting setup for the pump which if wrong would result in the remote limit detection not working. (Spot #4926) </li>
	<li>The advanced setting OZHILIMIT=1 can now also be used to active remote limit detection on Protocol 2 pumps. This is to enable limits on pumps which use the older ENVA boards which do not support the newer Protocol 2 limit commands.   <b>Note: check the FAQ page before using this setting on a Protocol 2 pump:</b> <a href="http://www.integration.co.nz/privdocs/FAQ-GilbarcoAus.htm">Gilbarco Australia FAQ</a>  (Spot #5057) </li>

<h3>Email (Email.DLL) v2.7.0</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Changed processing for Dispenser error condition 2 (Pump Computer Error) - pump state UNDEFINED_ERROR_PSTATE is no longer used (Spot#4129).</li>
 <li>Errors reported by the Pump Computer are now recorded in The Enabler Event Journal and the Windows Application Event log.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gilbarco (Gilbarco.DLL) v2.37.4</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Fix: improved validation of pump responses to reject invalid message data. Previously communications problems could cause data to be inserted into pump responses which resulted in incorrect delivery details being recorded (Spot#4032).</li>
 <li>Gilbarco US:</li>
 <ul>
   <li>Fix: changed limit setting to ensure pumps stop at the authorised limit. This could occur when the nozzle was replaced quickly after being lifted, and would result in the pump being able to deliver without the limit applied (Spot#4125).</li>
   <li>Fix: resolved a problem that sometimes prevented valid deliveries being recorded on Encore pumps when a zero running total was reported by the pump at the end of delivery (Spot#3382).</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Gilbarco Australia:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Fix: incorrect logging of duplicate deliveries on Protocol 1 pumps when an authorisation times out and is cancelled.</li>
  <li>Added code to check delivery price after each delivery for Protocol 1 pumps. If the pump's price is incorrect, an automatic price change is started.</li>
  <li>Added advanced setting FORCEPRICECHANGE=1 for old Gilbarco Australia Protocol 2 pumps to fix issue where only one side of the pump changes price after a price change is sent to both sides (Spot #3812)  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Nuovo Pignone (NuovoPignone.DLL) v1.8.8</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>No longer creates a duplicate delivery when the pump reports zero money e-totals and same volume, amount and volume e-totals as the previous delivery (Spot#3809).</li>
 <li>Updated to use UNDEFINED_ERROR_PSTATE only when the pump is idle - if an error occurs during delivery the error state is note reported until the delivery is completed.</li>
 <li>Added ETOTALS=0 advanced setting to allow electronic totals to be disabled - required for some pumps that respond to totals requests with invalid data.</li>
 <li>Now returns to LOCKED_PSTATE immediately after delivery has been logged.</li>
 <li>Fixed minor problem with status requests during delivery.</li>
 <li>Now supports loading limit after nozzle lifted, by setting LIMITATAUTH=1. This allows limits to be set for more than one hose. Recommended for use with OPTs, but not supported on some pumps.</li>
 <li>When not using LIMITATAUTH setting, if a limit is loaded and then times out it is cleared from the pump instead of remaining indefinitely.</li>
 <li>Pump error conditions now show UNDEFINED_ERROR_PSTATE and are logged to The Enabler Event Journal.</li>
 <li>For better compatibility with pumps, now defaults to use Stop command (so after temp stop the delivery cannot be resumed). To activate Pause/Resume functionality the USEPAUSE=1 advanced setting should be used (not supported by some pumps).</li>
 <li>Low product level error now causes Enabler to go to UNDEFINED_ERROR_PSTATE after delivery is completed (Spot#2622). If detected during delivery, delivery is stopped immediately.</li>
 <li>Implemented price control functionality, so price changes are now validated and verified. This fixes some possible lost price change situations, and also allows price changes to go through in attendant mode.</li>
 <li>Resolved some exception conditions related to Pump Server restart.</li>
 <li>Changed logic for running total requests to improve performance.</li>
 <li>Added some new log messages for easier diagnosis.</li>
 <li>Updated to clear host and pump blocks after each delivery to allow recovery from some transient error conditions - error conditions are not cleared after 60 sec by default.</li>

<h3>NZ Protocol (PEC.DLL) v2.5.5</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Updated processing for Actronic LPG scales:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Changed processing of fee deliveries; the volume is now calculated based on the fee and unit price. Previously these deliveries were logged with a zero volume, so were normally cleared by Pump Server because they were below the min-delivery.</li>
  <li>The DELIVERY_FINISHING_PSTATE is no longer used since it is often misleading because of the way fuel flow happens on these dispensers.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Fix: Delivery processing now prevents duplicate deliveries being recorded on pumps configured as Retron-80. (Spot#3839, #4047)</li>

<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>New driver and pump type to add support for Dong Hwa Prime pumps.</li>
</ul>

<h3>NZ Protocol (PEC.DLL) v2.5.1</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Improved response processing to ensure reliable delivery logging (Ref#40266).</li>
 <li>Slowed down running total requests to ensure responsive control when more than 8 pumps on one loop are delivering at the same time.</li>
 <li>Improved support for Compac SPDs with two new Pump Types (Spot#3390):</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Compac SPD 5-digit</li>
  <li>Compac SPD 6-digit</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Updated to ensure all hoses are correctly re-enabled after a single hose has been authorised but no fuel delivered (Spot#3266).</li>
 <li>When in CALLING_PSTATE and the customer replaces the hose and selects another, the driver now returns to LOCKED_PSTATE before reporting the new calling hose (Spot#3268).</li> 
 <li>Fixed a price change issue encountered on a Single Hose Compac pump (Spot#3261).</li>
 <li>Fixed so DELIVERY_FINISHING_PSTATE is not reported unless some fuel has been delivered (Spot#3286).</li>
 <li>Improved validation of delivery data (Ref #39767).</li>
 <li>Updated to prevent selection of a different hose after authorisation when authorised for a single hose (Ref#36662, Ref#38165).</li>
 <li>Updated to retrieve final delivery details if Dispenser power fails during delivery (Ref#37024, Ref#35918).</li>
 <li>Fixed an issue with running totals requests when pumps are temp stopped.</li>
 <li>Changed state reported when a nozzle is hung up in DELIVERY_STARTING_PSTATE (before fuel flow). Enabler now reports DELIVERY_FINISHED_PSTATE, which clears the authorisation (Ref#38505).</li>
 <li>Fixed incorrect reporting of DELIVERY_STARTING_PSTATE in some situations (Ref#38506).</li>
 <li>Added code to clear dispensers stuck in DELIVERY_FINISHED_PSTATE due to pulser errors (Ref#38749).</li>

</ul>
<br>


<!-- -->
<br><h2>Pump Update - 27 Oct 2006</h2>


<h3>Gilbarco (Gilbarco.DLL) v2.36.8</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Fixed a bug in delivery logging for Gilbarco US pumps.</li>
 <li>Added advanced setting (GILBARCO_EURO=1) for compatibility with the European pumps that communicate using Gilbarco US protocol and pump types.</li>
 <li>Fixed compatibility with Gilbarco Australia Enterprise. Activation of 6-digit operation on Gilbarco Australia pumps now requires PROTOCOL2EXT=1 advanced setting.</li>
 <li>Fixed processing of electronic totaliser values for Australian pumps.</li>
 <li>Compiled with latest pump driver library to improve rejection of invalid prices - if one or more prices are invalid no new prices are sent to the pump.</li>
 <li>Changed communications settings for Australian pumps to resolve an intermittent problem receiving electronic totalisers from 4 hose pumps.</li>
 <li>Included processing to reject invalid prices.</li>
 <li>Fixed problem that sometimes causes pumps to change from INVALID_PRICE_PSTATE back to LOCKED_PSTATE when the price is still invalid.</li>
 <li>Fixed a problem in the Australian startup initialisation sequence that sometimes blocked operation of operation of pumps.</li>
 <li>Renamed Gilbarco Australia pump types to match the more widely recognised protocol types 1/2. The previous HoseID functionality is no longer available, but authorisation with a hose restriction works correctly. The pump types are now: 
     <ul>
        <li>"Gilbarco Aus Protocol 1" for old single hose pumps </li>
        <li>"Gilbarco Aus Protocol 2" for newer single and multi-hose pumps</li> 
     </ul>
 <li>The driver now automatically activates 6-digit operation for Protocol 2 pumps that support it - If authorised without any limit pumps in this mode can deliver up to $9990 or 9990L.</li>
 <li>Some old pump firmware versions only allow limits up to $99, but most Australian pumps can now be authorised with limits up to $920 or 920L - this applies even for pumps in 6-digit mode.</li>
 <li>Authorisation limits are now correctly sent to the pump even when authorising after lifting the nozzle (Ref#32450).</li>
 <li>Improved authorisation sequence and pump states reported for Enterprise pumps after a price change - the pump's start of delivery sequence takes longer for the first delivery after price change (Ref#31578,Ref#33791).</li>
</ul>

<h3>IFSF (IFSF.DLL) v2.6.14</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Added code to log events when a Tank Gauge console stops responding - one event is logged for each connected probe.</li>
 <li>Improved compatibility with Salzkotten IFSF Converters that do not support the 'All transactions' request.</li>
 <li>Incorrectly formatted running totals messages are now ignored.</li>
 <li>Improved error recovery if the transaction (delivery) details sent by the pump is not formatted correctly.</li>
 <li>Improved message validation, and added diagnostic logging when validation fails.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tatsuno (Tatsuno.DLL) v2.5.18</h3>
<ul class="spacedlist">
 <li>Timing of sending message has been slowed down.  This was causing comms problems against several models of Tatsuno pumps.   The side effect of this change is communication with Tatsuno pumps is now slightly slower, so start-up processing will take longer (about 15 seconds for a pump).  This change is also associated with being able to recover from communications errors reliably.</li>
 <li>After an authorisation message is sent the pump status is requested. This has been modified so that it is not possible for a communication error to cause a failure to send and process the response for a status request.  This ensures that the authorisation process completes and the pump is reported in DELIVERY_STARTING_PSTATE (state 26).</li>
 <li>A product mapping of zero is now supported.  This was primarily causing a problem in Tatsuno pump manufactured in China.</li>
 <li>Tatsuno pumps manufactured in China should now use the Pump Type �Tatsuno China Single Hose �. Refer to the <a href="http://www.integration.co.nz/privdocs/FAQ-Tatsuno.htm">Tatsuno FAQ</a> for more information. This pump type is not required for Tatsuno pumps manufactured in Japan.  The following changes are only enabled by selection of the �Tatsuno China� pump type.</li>
   <ul>
    <li>There is now an alternate price setting mechanism for Tatsuno pumps using the Tatsuno China pump type.  This does not impact pumps setup as Tatsuno Sunny MPD (SS-LAN).</li>
    <li>Chinese pumps only support one nozzle.  Enabler will now display a warning message if multiple nozzles attempt to be configured for these pumps.  The driver will only ever send single nozzle messages to these pumps.</li>
    <li>Introduction of a small delay after nozzle is replaced after end of a delivery is reported to allow the pump more processing time to complete end of delivery processing such as updating its electronic totals before Enabler requests delivery information.</li>
   </ul>

 <li>Correction to a minor problem in the authorisation resend sequence which could occasionally result in the DELIVERY_STARTING_PSTATE not being reported.</li>
 <li>Correction to the processing for resend of the cancel authorisation message which is sent each time the nozzle is replaced.  This could occasionally fail to send and therefore possibly leave the pump authorised.</li>
 <li>Running totals not received by application.  Enabler is designed to start requesting running totals once the pump report delivering.  This has now been changed so that running totals will start when either the pump reports delivering or after a short timeout from authorisation.</li>
 <li>Correction to a problem in the authorisation resend sequence where this could occasionally interrupt other processing.</li>
 <li>Correction to a problem caused when a pump comes back online and requests initialization interfering with processing already in progress.</li>
 <li>Improvements to handling end of delivery processing in the situation where the pump returns to nozzle in without reporting an DELIVERY_FINISHED_PSTATE.  Associated with this is a timer increased to 5 seconds (was 2 seconds).  This processing covers when pump deviates from expected end of delivery state flow.</li>

 <li>Added code to set the maximum volume and money limit values for authorisation based on the display format (and display widths).  Any limit above the maximum display values will be reduced to a value that will fit on the display.</li>
 <li>Changed the logic used to request running totals to prevent loops requesting running totals.</li>
 <li>Added remote limit functionality to allow the use of allocation limits (where the limit is set after the nozzle is lifted). This is activated by the REMOTELIMIT=1 advanced setting, and will cause the stop command to be used after the pump passes the limit (the limit will be overshot).</li>
